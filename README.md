# KoalaTs Framework üê®

KoalaTs is a NodeJs, TypeScript-first framework with expressive syntax. KoalaTS is crafted for the laziest backend
developers because nothing pairs better with clean APIs than a good nap. The NodeJs ecosystem is vast and full of
sparse solutions that doesn't always play well together. KoalaTs aims to provide a cohesive and opinionated solution
that is easy to use and understand.
